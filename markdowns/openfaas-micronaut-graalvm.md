Micronaut is a framework for building microservices and serverless functions for the JVM.
Learn more about it at [micronaut.io](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html).

OpenFaaS makes it possible to run serverless code in your own docker swarm or kubernetes cluster.
In this tutorial, we will use OpenFaaS deployed in Kubernetes.

We will then create a micronaut function that showcases one of the framework's features: dependency injection (so that 
it's a little different from OpenFaaS' classical [java8 template](https://github.com/openfaas/templates/tree/master/template/java8).
